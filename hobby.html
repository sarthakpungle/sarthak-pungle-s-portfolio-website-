        <h1 id="co">About Coding or Computer programming</h1>
    
    
        <p class="my hobby"> <b>Computer programming is the process of performing a particular computation (or
                        more
                        generally, accomplishing a specific computing result), usually by designing and building
                        an
                        executable computer program. Programming involves tasks such as analysis, generating
                        algorithms,
                        profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of
                        algorithms
                        (usually in a chosen programming language, commonly referred to as coding).[1][2] The
                        source code of
                        a program is written in one or more languages that are intelligible to programmers,
                        rather than
                        machine code, which is directly executed by the central processing unit. The purpose of
                        programming
                        is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task
                        (which can be as
                        complex as an operating system) on a computer, often for solving a given problem.
                        Proficient
                        programming thus usually requires expertise in several different subjects, including
                        knowledge of
                        the application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic.</p>
    
        <p class="code">Tasks accompanying and related to programming include testing, debugging, source code
                maintenance, implementation of build systems, and management of derived artifacts, such as the
                machine
                code of computer programs. These might be considered part of the programming process, but often
                the term
                software development is used for this larger process with the term programming, implementation,
                or
                coding reserved for the actual writing of code. Software engineering combines engineering
                techniques
                with software development practices. Reverse engineering is a related process used by designers,
                analysts, and programmers to understand and re-create/re-implement.[3]</b></p>
